# Introduction to Julia

A series of small and self-contained projects for getting the hang of the Julia language.

Each directory is the root of a project. In some cases, these projects are [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks. If that's the case, probably there will also be an HTML version, or something similar.
